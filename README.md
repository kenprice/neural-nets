# Neural net assignment

- TASK 1:  Neural network with only 1 hidden layer with 15 neurons.
- TASK 2:  Neural network with only 1 hidden layer with 150 neurons.
- TASK 3:  Neural network with 2 hidden layers with 100 neurons in first hidden layer and 15 neurons in the second hidden layer.
- TASK 4:  Neural network with 2 hidden layer with 500 neurons in first hidden layer and 150 neurons in the second hidden layer.

Based off code from
https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3%20-%20Neural%20Networks/multilayer_perceptron.py

Usage:
`./test.sh` to run all the tasks and measure their accuracy after training.
